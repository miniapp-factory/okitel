```
Create a surreal app concept called “DreamFolding Atlas.”
The app allows users to fold, twist, and distort reality by manipulating their dreams stored as digital objects.
Users upload text, photos, or voice, and the app transforms them into dream-cubes, emotion-clouds, or memory-rivers.
Design tools for bending dreams, crossbreeding memories, generating impossible landscapes, and creating dream timelines.
Include random events such as “dream quakes,” “memory storms,” and “identity echoes.”
The UI should behave like a living organism: shifting, dripping, morphing slowly as users interact with it.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values to match the new “DreamFolding Atlas” concept.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this new file to describe the logo that should be generated for the app.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
