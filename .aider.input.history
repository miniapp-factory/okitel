+Code the following app
+```
+Create a surreal app concept called “DreamFolding Atlas.”
+The app allows users to fold, twist, and distort reality by manipulating their dreams stored as digital objects.
+Users upload text, photos, or voice, and the app transforms them into dream-cubes, emotion-clouds, or memory-rivers.
+Design tools for bending dreams, crossbreeding memories, generating impossible landscapes, and creating dream timelines.
+Include random events such as “dream quakes,” “memory storms,” and “identity echoes.”
+The UI should behave like a living organism: shifting, dripping, morphing slowly as users interact with it.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
